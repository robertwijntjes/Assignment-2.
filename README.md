The Sprite for the ship and the Sound Effects do not belong to me and I am just using them for personal use.

Most of the Project was completed using a usb as a backup along with a homemade script for saving.The Github only has about 1/3 of the actual commits..but atleast it
Shows the later commits to half complete to complete project.Found Github was alot more usefull than previous method.

==Issues==
The only issue i had was with processing and its memory problems.Sounds for the bullet need to be disabled to get a good score as holding down the spacebar key may cause
processing to throw a memory error.Can be disabled inside the ship class for the 2 lines above the comment.Just comment the code out using ' // '
